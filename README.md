docker-ruby
===========

A quick and dirty ruby box

## What does it do?
Currently installs and compiles Ruby version 2.1.4 on Ubuntu 14.04

## How do I use?
Run build.sh, this will build an image as per the Dockerfile, name defaults to tlcowling/ruby:2.1.4

## Any thoughts?
Also installs bundler as a gem, though it does this as the root user which is not necessarily desirable...
